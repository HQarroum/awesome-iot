IEEE 802.15.4 is a standard which specifies the physical layer and media access control for low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs). It is maintained by the IEEE 802.15 working group, which has defined it in 2003. It is the basis for the ZigBee, ISA100.11a, WirelessHART, and MiWi specifications, each of which further extends the standard by developing the upper layers which are not defined in IEEE 802.15.4. Alternatively, it can be used with 6LoWPAN and standard Internet protocols to build a wireless embedded Internet. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4)

> IEEE standard 802.15.4 intends to offer the fundamental lower network layers of a type of wireless personal area network (WPAN) which focuses on low-cost, low-speed ubiquitous communication between devices. It can be contrasted with other approaches, such as Wi-Fi, which offer more bandwidth and require more power. The emphasis is on very low cost communication of nearby devices with little to no underlying infrastructure, intending to exploit this to lower power consumption even more.

#### <img width="50" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/BluetoothLogo.svg/770px-BluetoothLogo.svg.png" /> - [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) (Bluetooth Special Interest Group)

Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz) from fixed and mobile devices, and building personal area networks (PANs). Invented by telecom vendor Ericsson in 1994, it was originally conceived as a wireless alternative to RS-232 data cables. It can connect several devices, overcoming problems of synchronization. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth)

> Bluetooth is managed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), which has more than 25,000 member companies in the areas of telecommunication, computing, networking, and consumer electronics.

6LoWPAN is an acronym of IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks. 6LoWPAN is the name of a concluded working group in the Internet area of the IETF. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6LoWPAN)

> The 6LoWPAN concept originated from the idea that "the Internet Protocol could and should be applied even to the smallest devices,"and that low-power devices with limited processing capabilities should be able to participate in the Internet of Things.
The 6LoWPAN group has defined encapsulation and header compression mechanisms that allow IPv6 packets to be sent and received over IEEE 802.15.4 based networks. IPv4 and IPv6 are the work horses for data delivery for local-area networks, metropolitan area networks, and wide-area networks such as the Internet. Likewise, IEEE 802.15.4 devices provide sensing communication-ability in the wireless domain. The inherent natures of the two networks though, are different.

#### <img width="50" src="http://www.twice.com/sites/default/files/styles/blog_content/public/ThreadGroupLogo_4_3_0.jpg?itok=SmyKXf7r" /> - [Thread](http://threadgroup.org/) (Thread Group)

> The standards development of HTTP was coordinated by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), culminating in the publication of a series of Requests for Comments (RFCs). The first definition of HTTP/1.1, the version of HTTP in common use, occurred in RFC 2068 in 1997, although this was obsoleted by RFC 2616 in 1999.

#### <img width="50" src="https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/images/ibeacon-logo.svg" /> - [iBeacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon) (Apple)

iBeacon is a protocol standardized by Apple and introduced at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in 2013. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon)

> iBeacon uses Bluetooth low energy proximity sensing to transmit a universally unique identifier picked up by a compatible app or operating system. The identifier can be used to determine the device's physical location, track customers, or trigger a location-based action on the device such as a check-in on social media or a push notification.

#### <img width="50" src="http://blog.thingstud.io/wp-content/uploads/mqttorg.png" /> - [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) (IBM)

MQTT (formerly MQ Telemetry Transport) is a publish-subscribe based "light weight" messaging protocol for use on top of the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a "small code footprint" is required or the network bandwidth is limited. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT)

> The publish-subscribe messaging pattern requires a message broker. The broker is responsible for distributing messages to interested clients based on the topic of a message. Andy Stanford-Clark and Arlen Nipper of Cirrus Link Solutions authored the first version of the protocol in 1999.

#### <img width="50" src="https://stomp.github.io/images/project-logo.png" /> - [STOMP](https://stomp.github.io/)

Simple (or Streaming) Text Oriented Message Protocol (STOMP), formerly known as TTMP, is a simple text-based protocol, designed for working with message-oriented middleware (MOM). - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_Text_Oriented_Messaging_Protocol)

> STOMP provides an interoperable wire format that allows STOMP clients to talk with any message broker supporting the protocol. It is thus language-agnostic, meaning a broker developed for one programming language or platform can receive communications from client software developed in another language.

#### <img width="50" src="https://www.rabbitmq.com/wp-uploads/2012/02/HTML5_Logo_256.png" /> - [Websocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

WebSocket is a protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

> WebSocket is designed to be implemented in web browsers and web servers, but it can be used by any client or server application. The WebSocket Protocol is an independent TCP-based protocol. The WebSocket protocol makes more interaction between a browser and a website possible, facilitating live content and the creation of real-time games. This is made possible by providing a standardized way for the server to send content to the browser without being solicited by the client, and allowing for messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open.

#### <img width="50" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/XMPP_logo.svg" /> - [XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP) (IETF)
